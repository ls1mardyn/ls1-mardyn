//! @brief This class is provides an interface for the base class of the collective communication.
//! @details Refactored to increase code-reuse
//! @author Steffen Seckler
//!
//! To fully understand the purpose of this class, read the documentation
//! of the class CollectiveCommunication. The application developer should not
//! have to care whether the program will be executed in parallel or sequentially.
//! The only thing that the application developer should know that there might
//! be several processes and at some point in the simulation those have to do a
//! collective communication to broadcast or reduce values. Those values are
//! given to the domain decomposition method, the communication command is executed
//! by the domain decomp and the values can be read again. This class just has to
//! ensure that this also works if there is no real domain decomposition but the
//! class DomainDecompBase is used.
