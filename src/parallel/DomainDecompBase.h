//! @brief handle boundary region and multiple processes
//! @author Martin Buchholz, Nikola Tchipev
//!
//! This program is designed to run on a HPC (High Performance Computer).
//! But sometimes one might want to execute it on a single processor, possibly even
//! without having MPI installed on that machine. One way to allow this would be to
//! have two different versions of the program, one sequential version and one parallel version.
//! But that isn't feasible, as it is hardly possible to keep them both up to date without
//! investing a lot of additional time.
//! Before describing how this problem is solved, you'll have to know a little bit about
//! how the parallel version works.
//!
//! At the moment, domain decomposition is used. The basic idea is, that the region which
//! is simulated (usually a cube) is divided into several smaller regions. Each process
//! works on one of those regions. But as the molecules move between regions, the processes
//! have to communicate to exchange molecules. Also for the calculation of some values
//! (e.g. macroscopic values), communication is necessary. Each time processes need
//! to communicate, a method of this interface (that means a method of a class implementing
//! this interface) is called, which then somehow does the communication.
//!
//! Assume you have an class which implements this interface and which is capable of
//! doing all the necessary stuff for the parallelization. Further assume that
//! you have a second class which also implements this interface which is only capable
//! of handling one process but doesn't need any MPI (with only one process, there is
//! no need for message passing between processes). So the main program (or in this
//! case the class Simulation) can decide which implementation to use. When MPI is
//! available, the parallel version is used, otherwise the sequential version
