/** @brief KD tree based domain decomposition for better load balancing.
 *
 * The basic idea is to build up all possible subdivisions and do a A*-like
 * search of the best subdivision.
 *
 * The function to minimize is the load imbalance:
 * \f[\sum_{i \in \text{children}} (\text{load}_i - \text{optimalLoad})^2\f]
 *
 * During the downward pass an estimate is the expected load imbalance, which is
 * averaged over all children, in the upward pass, the exact imbalance is calculated.
 *
 * \note It is important for the A*-search that the estimate is an
 *       underestimation (<=) of the load imbalance.
 *
 * \note Some computation of the deviation / expected deviation is done in KDNode.
