/**
 * @brief Checks if a given molecule is leaving the given region in the next timestep,
 * with added scalar velocity adjustment, but only in the given dimension.
 *
 * The molecule's position and velocity in the specified dimension is extracted
 * from the molecule itself, and the next position is calculated using the
 * velocity adjustment and the timestep length.
 *
 * If the molecule was already out of the box (and stay out of the box after position adjustment), this function returns
 * true. If the molecule somehow ends up entering the box after the position adjustment, the function returns false.
 *
 * When this function is called, it is usually expected that the forces have
 * been updated for the current timestep and the positions and velocities
 * aren't. Hence the nextStepVelAdjustment is provided to the caller function,
 * so that it can handle the change in velocity due to forces. This is not done
 * by the util function itself, to keep it as generic as possible.
 *
 * @param molecule the molecule to be checked
 * @param regionBegin the start of the region to be checked
 * @param regionEnd the end of the region to be checked
 * @param dimension the dimension in which the molecule's new position must be calculated, to check for leaving
 * @param timestepLength the length of the whole time step, after which the molecule's position is calculated
 * @param nextStepVelAdjustment a flat scalar velocity added to the velocity in the `dimension` component after
 * calculations
 * @return true if the molecule would leave the box after timestepLength
