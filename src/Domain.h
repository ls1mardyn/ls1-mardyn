//! @brief This class is used to read in the phasespace and to handle macroscopic values
//! @author Martin Bernreuther <bernreuther@hlrs.de> et al. (2011)
//!
//! This class is responsible for all macroscopic values.
//! It is important to differentiate between local and global version of those values
//! Macroscopic values are values that aggregate some property of a set of molecules.
//! As this program is designed to run on a parallel computer, there are typically
//! several processes. Each process has an instance of this class, but with a different
//! subset of molecules. Therefore, also the macroscopic values are only representative
//! for the "local" domain of that process.
//!
//! member variables that represent "local" macroscopic values begin with _local
//!
//! properties of the global system begin with _global if only the rank 0 process
//! obtains the correct value (e.g., as a sum over corresponding local properties)
//! and with _universal if the global value must be communicated to all processes.
//!
//! At some points of the simulation, macroscopic values for the whole set of molecules
//! have to be calculated. Those values are stored in member variables beginning with _global.

	//! @brief initialize far field correction parameters
	//!
	//! By limiting the calculation to pairs of particles which have
	//! less distance than the given cutoff radius, an error is made
	//! By calculating approximations for the neglected pairs, the
	//! error can be reduced.
	//! The way the cutoff correction works is probably explained
	//! by all books on molecular simulation, e.g. Allen/Tildesley [1].
	//!
	//! The idea is that for radii above the cutoff radius, the
	//! radial distribution function is assumed to be exactly one, so
	//! that the correction for the internal energy as well as the
	//! virial can be obtained immediately from an integral over the
	//! pair potential and its derivative, respectively.
	//! For quadrupoles, the long-range correction turns out to be zero
	//! so that it is not calculated here. Molecules with point charges
	//! and a zero net charge interact over long distances according to
	//! their dipole moments, which is why effective dipoles are
	//! calculated for the far field correction.
	//!
	//! If ions appear, so that the net charge of a molecule is distinct
	//! from zero, the far field terms become much more complicated, and
	//! THAT IS NOT IMPLEMENTED AT PRESENT.
