/** @brief Base class for all Profile outputs used by KartesianProfile.
 *
 * The major steps for all profiles are <b>recording</b> the profile data, <b>communication</b>, writing the <b>output file</b>
 * and <b>resetting</b> everything for the next recording period. Each of these steps has a function associated with it that
 * needs to be implemented by all profiles inheriting this class to be able to work with KartesianProfile.
 * KartesianProfile also needs to know the number of items added to the communication per
 * Molecule. So a DensityProfile should return 1 via Profile::comms(). A Velocity3dProfile should return 3. <br>
 * A very simple <b>example</b> of how to use this class is the DensityProfile.
