	 *
	 * The present version of Mardyn provides the option of
	 * equilibrating the system at an increased temperature. This has,
	 * of course, the advantage that the equilibration is accelerated.
	 * In a special case that is of particular interest to a relevant
	 * subset of the developers, namely MD simulation of nucleation,
	 * it also reduces the amount of clusters formed during
	 * equilibration. Then, the actual nucleation process can be
	 * investigated for the equilibrated system.
	 *
	 * Equilibration at an increased temperature is nothing new, in
	 * principle it could be considered a variant of simulated
	 * annealing. For the purpose of accelerating the relaxation,
	 * starting from an unrealistic initial state, it was e.g.
	 * proposed in the thesis of M. Kreitmeir.
	 *
	 * The key parameter to regulating the equilibration is
	 * this->_initCanonical. The system is gradually heated and cooled
	 * again, and from this->_initCanonical on the temperature is
	 * constant (i.e. this method returns 1.0).
	 *
	 * Thus, if temperature increase is to be avoided, the user should
	 * set the "initCanonical" parameter to "0".
