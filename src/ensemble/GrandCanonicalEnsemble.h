/** @brief GrandCanonicalEnsemble was moved here from Simulation.cpp and partially adapted to Ensemble base class<br>
 * <br>
 * The GrandCanonicalEnsemble probably used to be a functional muVT ensemble class, that was somewhat dropped with
 * the move to XML inputs. The routines were all over simulation.cpp but never ran.<br>
 * This is a STUB implementation, mainly lacking readXML and updateGlobalVariable.<br>
 * <br>
 * Work done till now:<br>
 *      - GrandCanonical inherits from Ensemble base class like the NVT Ensemble<br>
 *      - Ensemble Base was extended with additional calls at the appropriate points in the simulation loop<br>
 *      - Simulation.h/.cpp is rid of _lmu list and only uses general _ensemble calls<br>
 * <br>
 * To Do:<br>
 *      - Make GrandCanonical functional again<br>
 *      - Adapt oldInput style to XML<br>
 *      - Test against a known simulation result<br>
