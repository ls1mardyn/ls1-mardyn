Currently, the project ls1/Mardyn uses the testing framework CppUnit for writing unit tests. 
Following you find a short description on building Mardyn with CppUnit and executing the tests.

For information on how to write unit tests within Mardyn see "Writing Unit Tests". 

!!! Quick Instructions

The simplest way to build Mardyn/ls1 with Unit Tests, is to use the makefile and the 
cppunit-version contained in the subversion repository.

Change to the directory "src/" and type

\verbatim
make -f ../makefile/Makefile TESTS=1
\endverbatim

Execute the tests with
\verbatim
./MarDyn -t
\endverbatim


!!! Building Mardyn with Unit Tests

To build Mardyn with unit tests generally, the following conditions have to be met:
- the macro UNIT_TESTS has to be defined when compiling Mardyn
- the CppUnit header-files have to be in the include path
- you have to link against the CppUnit-Library or the compiled source code

If building without CppUnit, all source code in the  *\\test-directories cannot be
compiled and linked, so it has to be excluded from the build. 

!! Using the CppUnit-Source from the Mardyn-repository

The simplest way is to use the makefile distributed, with the option TESTS=1. Then 
the CppUnit source code which comes with the svn version is compiled and linked. Also all
tests will be compiled and linked.

!! Using a CppUnit Library

If there is already a cppUnit library installed on your system, it might be convenient
to use that one. Configure your build-system so that the conditions listed above 
are met, or replace the file makefile/cppunit.mk.  

!!! Running the unit tests

After building Mardyn with unit tests, call Mardyn with the commandline arguments
 "-t" or "--tests". The tests will then be executed. 
 
\note In cases you use the cppunit source code from the Mardyn repository, also 
the tests which test cppUnit itself will be executed.
