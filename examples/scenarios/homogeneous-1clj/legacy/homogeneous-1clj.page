/*! \page "Scenario Homogeneous 1CLJ-fluid"

!!! Description

In this scenario the 1CLJ fluid at T / N / ... in NVE ensemble is simulated. 
In the initial configuration, molecules are arranged on a bcc-grid at liquid
state, after approximately XXX timesteps the fluid is equilibrated and pressure
and RDF can be measured.

Subject of test is performance of the LegacyCellHandler.

!!! Features

- Single-site Lennard-Jones computation
- ...

!!! Generation of input set

xyz-generator with command line:

\verbatim
./xyz-generator par1 par2 par3
\endverbatim

!!! Performance on MAC-Cluster (Maximum Runtimes)
