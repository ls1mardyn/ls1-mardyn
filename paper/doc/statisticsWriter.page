/*! \page "StatisticsWriter"

!!! Usage

Add the line 
\verbatim
output StatisticsWriter n filename
\endverbatim
to the config file, where n is an integer number. It means that every n-th 
timestep an output file is generated. Replace filename with the name or path
for the output. It serves as base for name of the output file generated.

!!! Generated Files

Two file types are being generated: 
- one with data about the Linked-Cell container. It is generated once when the programme starts up.
- one containing a histogramm showing the distribution of molecules over the cells
  (number of molecules per cell)

!!! Plotting the histogram

You can draw a histogram, e.g. with Gnuplot. Copy the following skript to a file
(e.g. hist.gpi). Give in the last line the right file containing the histogram 
(e.g. lj10000_15.stat). Then let gnuplot execute the script: \verb+gnuplot hist.gpi+. 

\verbatim
set boxwidth 0.5 # Probably 3-5.
set style fill   solid 1.00 noborder
set xlabel "Number of Particles per Cell"
set ylabel "Number of Cells"
set terminal png # x999999 xffffff
set output 'histogramm.png'
set key off # Unless you really want a key
# For this next line, lw is linewidth (2-4)?
plot 'lj10000_15.stat' using 1:2 title 'myHistogramData' with boxes lw 5

\endverbatim
